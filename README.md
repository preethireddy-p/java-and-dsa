## Sorting Techniques - [Java Code](src/main/java/com/dsa/algorithms/service/sorting/SortingTechniques.java)

### 1. Selection Sort
Repeatedly select the lowest/highest element from the unsorted part of the list & place it after the sorted part of the list.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in all cases  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- ❌ Stable (default) (can me made stable)
- ✔️ In-place
- ✔️ Internal

### 2. Bubble Sort
Repeatedly swap the adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order, bringing the highest element to the end in each iteration.
**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in worst & avg, O(n) in best cases (already sorted)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
- ✔️ Stable
- ✔️ In-place
- ✔️ Internal

### 3. Insertion Sort
