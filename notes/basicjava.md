# Basic Java

## Terminology

### Inheritance
A subclass gets to inherit the properties (fields, methods, constructors) of its super class.
Benefits:
- Code reusability
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism  


### Polymorphism
The property of accessing objects as instances of the parent class rather than the actual class(subclass).
- Compile time / Static polymorphism (method overloading): having methods with the same name in a class but with different parameters, different return type(optional)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding): redefining/overriding a method in the subclass that is already present in the superclass.

### Encapsulation
The property of bundling the data (fields, methods) inside the object & exposing only the required components outside the object. Its done by "private" keyword.  
Benefits:
- Security & Access Control (data hiding)
- Flexible implementation of classes
- Modular design of code

### Dependency Injection
### Inversion of Control (IoC)
