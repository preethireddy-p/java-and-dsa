# Basic Java

## Terminology

### Inheritance
A subclass gets to inherit the properties (fields, methods, constructors) of its super class.
Benefits:
- Code reusability
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism  


### Polymorphism
The property of accessing objects as instances of the parent class rather than the actual class(subclass).
- Compile time / Static polymorphism (method overloading): having methods with the same name in a class but with different parameters, different return type(optional)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding): redefining/overriding a method in the subclass that is already present in the superclass.
